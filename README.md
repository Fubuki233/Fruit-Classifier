# Create an Image Classifier (CNN model) to classify images of fruits correctly

A Fruits dataset is provided that consists of these 4 classes:

- Apple only
- Orange only
- Banana only
- A mix of Fruits

Use the images in **Train.zip** and **Test.zip** to train and test your image classifier.

You are allowed to modify your training data (e.g. add/remove images), but not your testing data.

Document your experiments and results in improving your model’s accuracy.

The following activities can improve your model’s accuracy:

- Balance out the number of samples in each class
- Correct any mis-labelling in any of the 4 classes
- Determining the image-sizes to be used for training
- Image Augmentation to generate more data
- Generate any plots that you think can help the reader understand your work better.

## Data

The data `train.zip` and `test.zip` are found under the **Files/Team Project** menu.

# CA Rubics

| CRITERIA | DESCRIPTION | POINTS |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Model Accuracy | Try to train your model to obtain **at least 92% accuracy** on the test data. | **5** |
| Model Training Experiments | Experiments done to achieve better model accuracy (e.g. pre-processing, different network architectures) | **15** |
| Report | Documentation of your training process, generation of plots and analysis of changes in results. | **5** |

# Deliverables

Hand in a **zip file** of your report and source codes.  
Your report should contain details of your experiments.  
In addition, provide plots to summarise your experiments.

Name your submission as `<your_team_number>.zip`.

For example, if you are in Team 1, the submitted filename should be:
